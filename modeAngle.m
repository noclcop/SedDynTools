function [thetaM]=modeAngle(theta,Ares)

%{
modeAngle, v 1.0 (Matlab 2013b)

calcluate the mode value from an array of polar directions (the most 
popular direction), at a set resolution.  This is better than a mean as it 
is not affected by extreme values.

Resolution is +/- res.

A check is done for the 360 to zero ambiguity

A uni-modal direction is assumed, if there are multiple modes this function
will give bad results.  This effect can be reduced by using short records.
